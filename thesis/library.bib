	abstract = {Abstract. Knowledge-intensive {CBR} assumes that cases are enriched with general domain knowledge. In {CREEK}, there is a very strong coupling between cases and general domain knowledge, in that cases are embedded within a general domain model. This increases the knowledge-intensiveness of the cases themselves. A knowledge-intensive {CBR} method calls for powerful knowledge acquisition and modeling techniques, as well as machine learning methods that take advantage of the general knowledge represented in the system. The focusing theme of the paper is on cases as knowledge within a knowledgeintensive {CBR} method. This is made concrete by relating it to the {CREEK} architecture and system, both in general terms, and through a set of example projects where various aspects of this theme have been studied. 1},

Army ants build bridges using their own bodies along the path from a food to the nest. We developed the army ant inspired social evolutionary system which can perform the altruism. The system has 2 kinds of ant agents, {`Major} ant' and {`Minor} ant' and their ants communicate with each other via pheromones. The other ants can recognize them as the signals from the other ants. The pheromones evaporate with the certain ratio and diffused into the space of neighbors stochastically. If the optimal bridge is found, the path through the bridge is the shortest from foods to the nest. However, the simulation results may show two or more bridges. We propose the constructing method of the optimal bridge to define the probability for an ant to leave a bridge at a low occupancy condition of ants. The computer simulation results are described in this paper.},

	abstract = {A 'green-beard' gene is defined as a gene that causes a phenotypic effect (such as the presence of a green beard or any other conspicuous feature), allows the bearer of this feature to recognize it in other individuals, and causes the bearer to behave differently towards other individuals depending on whether or not they possess the feature. Such genes have been proposed on theoretical grounds to be agents mediating both altruism and intragenomic conflicts,, but until now few, if any, of these genes have been identified,. Here we provide evidence of a green-beard gene in the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. In polygyne (multiple-queen) colonies, all egg-laying queens are Bb heterozygotes at the locus Gp-9 (ref. 6). Previous studies suggested that bb females die prematurely from intrinsic causes; we now show that {BB} queens initiating reproduction are killed by workers, and that it is primarily Bb rather than {BB} workers that are responsible for these executions. This implies that allele Gp-9 b is linked to a green-beard allele that preferentially induces workers bearing the allele to kill all queens that do not bear it. Workers appear to distinguish {BB} from Bb queens on the basis of a transferable odour cue.},

This paper discusses the concept of fitness for ‘interactive’ traits in the context of two recent theoretical developments: a mathematical approach to population genetics that takes the frequencies and fitnesses of whole phenotypes (instead of individual genes) as primitive variables (Layzer, 1978a); and a new hypothesis concerning genetic variation (Layzer, 1978b), which implies that functionally equivalent traits are likely to arise simultaneously in many distinct lineages in a population. As a result, the fitness (as here defined) of an interactive trait may differ significantly from its inclusive fitness (in the Haldane-Hamilton sense). In particular, group selection need not be invoked to account for the evolution of behaviors that diminish inclusive fitness.},

This paper focuses on altruism based on kin selection in environments in which there is little migration of individuals (“viscous populations”). Two simulations show that the evolution of evolutionarily stable non-reciprocal altruism is possible in societies with limited dispersal, confirming earlier research [1]. It has been questioned, however, whether these conditions occur in natural situations. This paper demonstrates that if the tendency to migrate is itself represented as a gene controlled by an evolutionary process, a tendency not to migrate evolves among altruists. Thus, the conditions which would allow the evolution of altruism are not merely a matter of coincidence, but are actively selected for, increasing the likelihood that it will be present in natural situations.},

Specialisation and cooperation results from an evolutionary process in which selection and reproduction is based on individual fitness. Specialists come to help (through the donation of resources) their non-kin group members, optimising their behaviour as a team and producing a fitter group. The mechanism that promotes this benevolent, cooperative group behaviour is based on the concept of a “tag”. Tags1 are observable markings, cues or displays. Individuals can observe the tags of others and take alternative actions based on those observations (e.g. to altruistically2 help or not). We show that even random (or dumb) searching for appropriate partners produces significant levels of specialisation and cooperation. Additionally we demonstrate that non-random (or smart) searching dramatically increases the effect.},

Such relatedness may be enforced through particular selection mechanism (e.g. kin-recognition) as well as particular dispersion strategies (e.g. low dispersion favours local interactions). This paper presents results on the importance of the evolution of particular dispersion strategies whenever consumption strategies are enforced. A key result from this paper is that whenever altruism is difficult to display when consuming food (i.e. being unable to share while eating), higher dispersion behaviour are evolved, which is a counterintuitive result at first sight.},

Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. Each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.},

This effect both supports the evolution of altruism by focusing the altruists' gifts on relatives of the altruist, and also limits the extent to which altruism may emerge by exposing clusters of altruists to stiffer local competition. Previous analyses have emphasized the way in which these two effects can cancel, limiting the viability of altruism. These papers were based on models in which total population density was held fixed. We present here a class of models in which population density is permitted to fluctuate, so that patches of altruists are supported at a higher density than patches of non-altruists. Under these conditions, population viscosity can support the selection of both weak and strong altruism.},

	abstract = {Given its ubiquity, scale and complexity, few problems have created the combined interest of so many unrelated areas as the evolution of cooperation. Using the tools of evolutionary game theory, here we address, for the first time, the role played by intention recognition in the final outcome of cooperation in large populations of self-regarding individuals. By equipping individuals with the capacity of assessing intentions of others in the course of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma interactions, we show how intention recognition opens a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive, as it precludes the invasion of pure cooperators by random drift while remaining robust against defective strategies. Intention recognizers are able to assign an intention to the action of their opponents based on an acquired corpus of possible intentions. We show how intention recognizers can prevail against most famous strategies of repeated dilemmas of cooperation, even in the presence of errors. Our approach invites the adoption of other classification and pattern recognition mechanisms common among Humans, to unveil the evolution of complex cognitive processes in the context of social dilemmas.},

Recent work has demonstrated that altruistic donation can evolve in surprisingly simple models, in which agents base their decisions to donate solely on the similarity of evolved ‘‘tags’ ’ relative to evolved tag-difference tolerances. There is disagreement, however, about the conditions under which tag-mediated altruism will in fact evolve. Here we vary two critical parameters in a standard model of tag-mediated altruism—genetic stability and territorial structure— and show that altruism evolves in a wide range of conditions. We demonstrate the evolution of significant levels of altruism even when the immediate costs to donors equal the benefits to recipients. We describe the mechanism that permits the emergence of altruism in the model as a form of kin selection that is facilitated by interactions between altruism, genetic drift, and fecundity.},

	abstract = {An agent-based evolutionary model of tag-mediated altruism is studied on large-scale complex networks addressing multiplayer one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma-like games with four competing strategies. Contrary to standard theoretical predictions, but in line with recent empirical findings, we observed that altruistic acts in non-repeated interactions can emerge as a natural consequence of recognition of heritable phenotypic traits such as visual tags, which enable the discrimination between potentially beneficial and unproductive encounters. Moreover, we identified topological regimes in which cooperation always prevails at short times, but where unconditional cooperators are favored over conditional tag-based helpers, even though the latter initially have a slight reproductive advantage. After very long times, we found that all four strategies appeared about equally often, meaning that only one quarter of agents refused cooperation egoistically. However, our study suggests that intra-tag generosity can quickly evolve to dominate over other strategies in spatially structured environments that are otherwise detrimental to cooperative behavior.

We show that cultural transmission can create a cultural evolutionary force toward indiscriminate altruism in a large randomly mixing population. The cultural transmission of a behavior (altruistic or selfish) disproportionately exposes those who acquire that behavior to that behavior prior to their acquisition of it. That is, individuals who have acquired an altruistic behavior through cultural transmission (i.e., who learned to behave altruistically from other people) were disproportionately exposed to the altruistic acts of others. Likewise, individuals who have acquired a selfish behavior through cultural transmission were disproportionately exposed to the selfish acts of others. Because of this disproportionate prior exposure, altruists have disproportionately benefitted from the altruistic acts of others, and selfish actors have disproportionately been hurt by the selfish acts of others.

	abstract = {Although kin recognition mechanisms are necessary neither for the operation of kin selection nor for optimal mate selection (e.g. inbreeding avoidance), once established, such mechanisms may accelerate the evolution of kin-directed behaviors. Aside from spatially-based recognition, in which organisms adjust their behavior principally in response to their immediate location, several behavioral mechanisms originally suggested by Hamilton recently have generated discussion and controversy. Familiar kin can be identified individually, but individual recognition mechanisms alone cannot serve to distinguish between closely and more distantly related kin, or to identify novel relatives. These kin can be identified through group recognition mechanisms that evaluate the extent of trait overlap among individuals to determine their probable genetic relatedness. Precisely whom an organism recognizes as kin using either type of mechanism may be dependent on its past social experience. Individual recognition permits discrimination of previously encountered conspecifics, whereas group recognition generally leads to discrimination of individuals sharing traits with previously encountered conspecifics. Individual and group recognition mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and they may operate concurrently. Furthermore, they are not distinct, separable processes. Mistaken individual identifications become more likely as conspecifics show increasing phenotypic resemblance, and hence kin discrimination can result directly from individual recognition mechanisms. The extent to which kin are identified depends on a criterion rule which may fluctuate in response to social, spatial, and temporal factors. When favored by natural selection, kin recognition may be facilitated by the process of stimulus generalization, as trait matching is achieved within wider tolerance ranges. But such generalization may occur even in the absence of selection per se.

Recognition effected through the action of hypothetical “recognition alleles” does not constitute a logical alternative to individual or group kin recognition mechanisms. In common with those processes, recognition allels must operate by the effective matching of phenotypes. Unlike kin recognition mechanisms, which assess similarity by generalized phenotypic comparisons, the phenotype compared by a recognition allele (or linkage group) is that it itself generates, leading to the possibility of intragenomic conflict. As suggested by Hamilton, alleles might be expected to induce their bearers to favor behaviorally conspecifics that share thier copies, regardless of the overall genetic relatedness of those conspecifics. Hence, recognition alleles, if they exist, would not invariably lead to kin identifications. Moreover, such alleles need not act in a manner that necessarily excludes learning.

Through inbreeding experiments, a genetic component to the labels that elicit kin recognition has been demonstrated in some invertebrates. Genetically determined kin recognition templates, with which the labels are compared, have yet to be established. A “genetic recognition system” cannot be safely inferred when experiments fail to demonstrate experiential effects on recognition abilities. Kin recognition mechanisms can be characterized through detailed examination of the ontogenetic and sensory processes underlying recognition abilities, and of the ecological and social contexts in which kin-directed behaviors are expressed.},

Here we extend current approaches to include four combinations of genetic team composition and level of selection. We compare the performance of genetically homogeneous teams evolved with individual-level selection, genetically homogeneous teams evolved with team-level selection, genetically heterogeneous teams evolved with individual-level selection, and genetically heterogeneous teams evolved with team-level selection. We use a simulated foraging task to show that the optimal combination depends on the amount of cooperation required by the task.

Two principles are presented, the first concerning the evolution of social behaviour in general and the second the evolution of social discrimination. Some tentative evidence is given.

More general application of the theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on certain points. Other subjects considered include warning behaviour, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects, clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other types of colonies, the confinement of parental care to true offspring in birds and insects, fights, the behaviour of parasitoid insect larvae within a host, parental care in connection with monogyny and monandry and multi-ovulate ovaries in plants in connection with wind and insect pollination.},

The emergence of consensus towards specific behavioural strategies is examined, with a particular focus on algorithmic stability.

Our approach considers a sub-individual framework, deﬁned at the level of genomes rather than agents, in order to provide an efﬁcient algorithmic solution for the emergent of coordination among the population. Experiments show that the proposed evolutionary adaptation algorithm favors the emergence of altruistic behavior under some assumptions regarding genome relatedness.

Significant progress has been made in determining the conditions that support cooperation in simple models, but the evolutionary dynamics that lead from noncooperative conditions to cooperation are still poorly understood. And, in more complex models, even the conditions that support cooperation are not well defined. In this paper we study the dynamics of the evolution of cooperation in both a simple tag-mediated cooperation model and in a more complex version of the same system in which there is multilevel competition----competition between both individuals and populations of individuals. The results show that the inclusion of multilevel competition has both quantitative effects (increasing the frequency and duration of the periods of cooperation) and qualitative effects (introducing a new stable state) on the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation.},

We show that cultural transmission can create a cultural evolutionary force toward indiscriminate altruism in a large randomly mixing population. The cultural transmission of a behavior (altruistic or selfish) disproportionately exposes those who acquire that behavior to that behavior prior to their acquisition of it. That is, individuals who have acquired an altruistic behavior through cultural transmission (i.e., who learned to behave altruistically from other people) were disproportionately exposed to the altruistic acts of others. Likewise, individuals who have acquired a selfish behavior through cultural transmission were disproportionately exposed to the selfish acts of others. Because of this disproportionate prior exposure, altruists have disproportionately benefitted from the altruistic acts of others, and selfish actors have disproportionately been hurt by the selfish acts of others.

Our multi-agent system is made up of autonomous agents with a behavior-based architecture. Agents learn the most suitable cooperative strategy for different environments by means of a reinforcement learning algorithm. Each agent receives a reinforcement signal that only measures its individual performance.

	title = {Coalition Factor in the Evolution of Non-Kin Altruism},
	abstract = {Animal behavior is often altruistic. In the frame of the theory of natural selection, altruism can only exist under specific conditions like kin selection or reciprocal cooperation. We show that reciprocal cooperation, which is generally invoked to explain non-kin altruism, requires very restrictive conditions to be stable. Some of these conditions are not met in many cases of altruism observed in nature. In search of another explanation of non-kin altruism, we consider Zahavis's theory of prestige. We extend it to propose a `political' model of altruism. We give evidence showing that non-kin altruism can evolve in the context of inter-subgroup competition. Under such circumstances, altruistic behavior can be used by individuals to advertise their quality as efficient coalition members. In this model, only abilities which positively correlate with the subgroup success can evolve into altruistic behaviors.},

Contrary to standard theoretical predictions, but in line with recent empirical findings, we observed that altruistic acts in non-repeated interactions can emerge as a natural consequence of recognition of heritable phenotypic traits such as visual tags, which enable the discrimination between potentially beneficial and unproductive encounters. Moreover, we identified topological regimes in which cooperation always prevails at short times, but where unconditional cooperators are favored over conditional tag-based helpers, even though the latter initially have a slight reproductive advantage. After very long times, we found that all four strategies appeared about equally often, meaning that only one quarter of agents refused cooperation egoistically. However, our study suggests that intra-tag generosity can quickly evolve to dominate over other strategies in spatially structured environments that are otherwise detrimental to cooperative behavior.},

I suggest that there likely is only one authentic mechanism of kin discrimination and that this mechanism is learning, particularly associative learning and habituation. Observed differences in the way animals discriminate between kin and non-kin are due only to the cues (e.g., individually-distinctive, family-distinctive, or self) that are used, and not to different mechanisms per se. I also consider whether kin discrimination is mediated by specially evolved kin recognition systems, defined as neural mechanisms that allow animals to directly classify conspecifics as either kin or non-kin. A preliminary analysis of vertebrate recognition systems suggests that specialized neural, endocrine, and developmental mechanisms specifically for recognizing kin have not evolved. Rather, kin discrimination results from an extension of other, non-specialized sensory and cognitive abilities of animals, and may be derived from other forms of social recognition, such as individual, group, or species recognition.},

Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices.

Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.},

	abstract = {The use of chemicals to communicate among organisms has enabled countless species, from microorganisms, to colonies of insects, to mammals, to survive and flourish in their respective environments. Ants, arguably nature's most successful exploiters of this behavior, have evolved the use of pheromones to communicate in a wide range of situations, including mating, colony recognition, territory marking, and recruitment to new nest sites and food sources. We examine the evolution of the use of pheromones to aid in the location of, and migration to, a target area by groups of digital organisms. In an initial set of experiments, these organisms evolved efficient patterns of exploration that obviated the need for pheromones. When evolved in a more adverse environment, organisms again evolved effective search strategies, but also evolved the use of pheromones to enable the task to be completed by group members more quickly and with fewer movements. We also show that evolved organisms are more robust and better able to react to a change in the environment than a handbuilt solution. This work demonstrates the complexities that exist in the evolution of pheromone-enabled cooperation and provides insight into the behaviors executed by seemingly simple organisms in nature.},

	abstract = {One of the enduring puzzles in biology and the social sciences is the origin and persistence of intraspecific cooperation and altruism in humans and other species. Hundreds of theoretical models have been proposed and there is much confusion about the relationship between these models. To clarify the situation, we developed a synthetic conceptual framework that delineates the conditions necessary for the evolution of altruism and cooperation. We show that at least one of the four following conditions needs to be fulfilled: direct benefits to the focal individual performing a cooperative act; direct or indirect information allowing a better than random guess about whether a given individual will behave cooperatively in repeated reciprocal interactions; preferential interactions between related individuals; and genetic correlation between genes coding for altruism and phenotypic traits that can be identified. When one or more of these conditions are met, altruism or cooperation can evolve if the cost-to-benefit ratio of altruistic and cooperative acts is greater than a threshold value. The cost-to-benefit ratio can be altered by coercion, punishment and policing which therefore act as mechanisms facilitating the evolution of altruism and cooperation. All the models proposed so far are explicitly or implicitly built on these general principles, allowing us to classify them into four general categories.},

Since then, numerous examples from a diverse array of taxa have shown that seemingly altruistic actions towards close relatives are a common phenomenon. Although many species use kin recognition to direct altruistic behaviours preferentially towards relatives, this important aspect of social biology is less well understood theoretically. I extend Hamilton's classic work by defining the conditions for the evolution of kin–irected altruism when recognizers are permitted to make acceptance (type I) and rejection (type {II)} errors in the identification of social partners with respect to kinship. The effect of errors in recognition on the evolution of kin–directed altruism depends on whether the population initially consists of unconditional altruists or non-altruists (i.e. alternative forms of non–recognizers). Factors affecting the level of these error rates themselves, their evolution and their long–term stability are discussed.},

We show that cultural transmission can create a cultural evolutionary force toward indiscriminate altruism in a large randomly mixing population. The cultural transmission of a behavior (altruistic or selfish) disproportionately exposes those who acquire that behavior to that behavior prior to their acquisition of it. That is, individuals who have acquired an altruistic behavior through cultural transmission (i.e., who learned to behave altruistically from other people) were disproportionately exposed to the altruistic acts of others. Likewise, individuals who have acquired a selfish behavior through cultural transmission were disproportionately exposed to the selfish acts of others. Because of this disproportionate prior exposure, altruists have disproportionately benefitted from the altruistic acts of others, and selfish actors have disproportionately been hurt by the selfish acts of others.
