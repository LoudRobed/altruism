README for ESN support in NNlib
=================================


INSTALL:
---------
 - You MUST have the gsl library installed (http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/).
 - You must change the following lines in your Makefile to support the gsl library :
	LDFLAGS      = `sdl-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL_image -lgsl
	INCLUDE      = -Iinclude/ext -Iinclude/contrib -Iinclude/core -Iprj/ -I/usr/include/gsl/
  (assuming '/usr/include/gsl' is where the includes of gsl are)
 - You must put the file 'ESN.cpp' in 'src/contrib/neuralnetworks/', and the file 'ESN.h' in 'include/contrib/neuralnetworks/'
 - The file 'ESNTester.cpp' is NOT required



USAGE AND REMARKS:
-------------------

- The file 'ESNTester.cpp' contains a simple test for ESNs (just call the function 'testESN()').
- To create a new ESN:

	ESN esn(weights, nbInputs, nbOutputs, reservoirSize, connectivity, alpha, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5,
			false,	// allowInputToOutputDirectConnections
			false,	// allowOutputSelfRecurrentConnections
			true,	// allowInputToReservoirConnections
			false 	// allowOutputToReservoirConnections
			);

- can be used as others neural networks of the NNlib:
	esn.setWeigths(weights);
	esn.setInputs(inputs);
	esn.step();
	outputs = esn.readOut();
	...


BUGS AND KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
----------------------------
- known bug when allowOutputSelfRecurrentConnections is true, on big reservoirs with high factor of connectivity.
- possible bug when allowOutputToReservoirConnections is true, with high factor of connectivity.
- possible bugs when allowOutputSelfRecurrentConnections is true and input == 0
