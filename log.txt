The robots are now able to create energy points by using an output of the perceptron. A threshold value decides if energy should be given away
and the amount the threshold is exceeded determines the amount of energy that is being given away. In my initial runs now, a great number of 
agents die quickly and I should probably make it even more rare to give away energy. A concern I have is that since the trait of being able to 
give away energy is intrinsic in all the agents and not an evolved trait, the level of realness is compromised.

Tried making the threshold a value set in the config file, but roborobo would have none of it, need to ask jean marc. Added some stuff for monitoring what's going on, but should probably 
make my own logFile that logs just the things I want.

todo: Energy dissipation, bugfixing. Log issues.

Today I need to decide how to implement the feature where the creation of energy points comes at a a cost that is greater than the
